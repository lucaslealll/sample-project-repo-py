# Directory for Final ETL Scripts

This folder is intended for storing the final ETL scripts.

- **These files are not modified!**
- They are stored here for reference while the refactoring process is ongoing.
- In essence, it acts as a backup for the main code.
- Files are of the types `.py` and `.ipynb`.

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase letters only.
- Use snake case (e.g., `application_name.py`).
- The naming format should follow the pattern: **Collection Platform + Collection Type + Storage Platform**.

### Example:

- Collection Platform: instagram
- Collection Type: media
- Storage Platform: bigquery

**Final filename**: `instagram_media_bigquery.py`
